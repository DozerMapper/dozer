<!--
    Default values that are applied to all mappings.  Global Configuration.

    Required Attributes:

    Optional Attributes:

            stop-on-errors   Indicates whether Dozer should stop mapping fields and throw the Exception if an error is encountered while performing a field mapping.
                             It is recommended that this is set to "true".
                             If set to "false", Dozer will trap the exception, log the error, and then continue mapping subsequent fields
                             The default value is "true".
               date-format   The string format of Date fields.  This is used for field mapping between Strings and Dates
                  wildcard   Inicates whether Dozer automatically map fields that have the same name.
                             This will typically be set to "true".  The default value is "true"
              trim-strings   Inicates whether Dozer automatically trims String values prior to setting the destination value.
                             The default value is "false"
              bean-factory   The factory class to create data objects.  This typically will not be specified.
                             By default Dozer constructs new instances of data objects by invoking the no-arg constructor
         relationship-type   Indications whether collections are mapped cumulative or non-cumulative.  cumulative indicates the element is added to the collection.
                             non-cumulative indicates the element will be added or an existing entry will be updated.
         custom-converters   The custom converters to be registered with Dozer.
        copy-by-references   Indicates which class types should always be copied by reference

<!--
    Specifies a custom field mapping.  Fields that share the same attribute name do not need to be defined.
    Dozer automatically maps fields that match on attribute name.  All Field Mapping definitions are bi-directional by default.
    Global configuration, Mapping, and Class element values are inherited.

    Hints are used for mapping Collection types.  A hint indicates which type of destination object should be created and added to the
    destination Collection.

    Required Attributes:

    Optional Attributes:

         relationship-type   For collections, indicates whether to add to existing values or to always replace any existing entries
         remove-orphans      For collections, indicates whether items that did not exist in the source collection should be removed from the destination collection.
                      type   Indicates whether this mapping is bi-directional or only one-way.  Typically this will be set to bi-directional.
                             The default is "bi-directional".
                    map-id   The id that uniquely identifies this mapping definition.  This typically will not be specified.

                             and when mapping between Map objects and Custom Data Objects.
         copy-by-reference   Indicates whether the source field value is copied by reference or by value when populating the destination field.
                             The default value is "false"
          custom-converter   Indicates that a specific custom converter should be used for mapping this field.  Typically this will not be specified.

    Optional Attributes:

               date-format   The string format of Date fields.  This is used for field mapping between Strings and Dates

                             By default, the beans attribute setter is used.
                get-method   Indicates which get method to invoke on the src object to get the field value  Typically this will not be specified.
                             By default, the beans attribute getter is used.
             is-accessible   Indicates whether Dozer bypasses getter/setter methods and accesses the field directly.
                             This will typically be set to "false".  The default value is "false".  If set to "true", the
                             getter/setter methods will NOT be invoked.  You would want to set this to "true" if
                             the field is lacking a getter or setter method.
