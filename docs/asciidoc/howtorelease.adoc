== How to Release
The following steps should be followed to perform a release:
- Build release notes [1]
- mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.X.X
- mvn versions:commit
- Update link:core/src/main/java/com/github/dozermapper/core/util/DozerConstants.java[DozerConstants.java]
- Update pom.xml - <building-tools.version/>
- Update dozer-version in docs for link:docs/asciidoc/documentation/gettingstarted.adoc[Getting Started]
- Update dozer-version in docs for link:docs/asciidoc/documentation/faq.adoc[FAQ]
- Finally, raise a PR. If the PR is built successfully and merged, TravisCI should automatically publish to Maven Central
